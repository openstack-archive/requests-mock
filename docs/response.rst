==================
Creating Responses
==================

.. note::

    The examples within use this syntax because response creation is a function of the adapter and not the mocker.
    All the same arguments can be provided to the mocker if that is how you use `requests_mock` within your project, and use the

    .. code:: python

        mock.get(url, ...)

    form in place of the given:

    .. code:: python

        adapter.register_uri('GET', url, ...)

Registering Responses
=====================

Responses are registered with the :py:meth:`requests_mock.Adapter.register_uri` function on the adapter.

.. doctest::

    >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', 'mock://test.com', text='Success')
    >>> resp = session.get('mock://test.com')
    >>> resp.text
    'Success'

:py:meth:`~requests_mock.Adapter.register_uri` takes the HTTP method, the URI and then information that is used to build the response. This information includes:

:status_code: The HTTP status response to return. Defaults to 200.
:reason: The reason text that accompanies the Status (e.g. 'OK' in '200 OK')
:headers: A dictionary of headers to be included in the response.

To specify the body of the response there are a number of options that depend on the format that you wish to return.

:json: A python object that will be converted to a JSON string.
:text: A unicode string. This is typically what you will want to use for regular textual content.
:content: A byte string. This should be used for including binary data in responses.
:body: A file like object that contains a `.read()` function.
:raw: A prepopulated :py:class:`urllib3.response.HTTPResponse` to be returned.

These options are named to coincide with the parameters on a :py:class:`requests.Response` object. For example:

.. doctest::

    >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', 'mock://test.com/1', json={'a': 'b'}, status_code=200)
    >>> resp = session.get('mock://test.com/1')
    >>> resp.json()
    {'a': 'b'}

    >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', 'mock://test.com/2', text='Not Found', status_code=404)
    >>> resp = session.get('mock://test.com/2')
    >>> resp.text
    'Not Found'
    >>> resp.status_code
    404

It only makes sense to provide at most one body element per response.

Dynamic Response
================

A callback can be provided in place of any of the body elements.
Callbacks must be a function in the form of

.. code:: python

    def callback(request, context):

and return a value suitable to the body element that was specified.
The elements provided are:

:request: The :py:class:`requests.Request` object that was provided.
:context: An object containing the collected known data about this response.

The available properties on the `context` are:

:headers: The dictionary of headers that are to be returned in the response.
:status_code: The status code that is to be returned in the response.
:reason: The string HTTP status code reason that is to be returned in the response.

These parameters are populated initially from the variables provided to the :py:meth:`~requests_mock.Adapter.register_uri` function and if they are modified on the context object then those changes will be reflected in the response.

.. doctest::

    >>> def text_callback(request, context):
    ...     context.status_code = 200
    ...     context.headers['Test1'] = 'value1'
    ...     return 'response'
    ...
    >>> adapter.register_uri('GET',
    ...                      'mock://test.com/3',
    ...                      text=text_callback,
    ...                      headers={'Test2': 'value2'},
    ...                      status_code=400)
    >>> resp = session.get('mock://test.com/3')
    >>> resp.status_code, resp.headers, resp.text
    (200, {'Test1': 'value1', 'Test2': 'value2'}, 'response')

Response Lists
==============

Multiple responses can be provided to be returned in order by specifying the keyword parameters in a list.
If the list is exhausted then the last response will continue to be returned.

.. doctest::

    >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', 'mock://test.com/4', [{'text': 'resp1', 'status_code': 300},
    ...                                                   {'text': 'resp2', 'status_code': 200}])
    >>> resp = session.get('mock://test.com/4')
    >>> (resp.status_code, resp.text)
    (300, 'resp1')
    >>> resp = session.get('mock://test.com/4')
    >>> (resp.status_code, resp.text)
    (200, 'resp2')
    >>> resp = session.get('mock://test.com/4')
    >>> (resp.status_code, resp.text)
    (200, 'resp2')


Callbacks work within response lists in exactly the same way they do normally;

.. doctest::

    >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', 'mock://test.com/5', [{'text': text_callback}]),
    >>> resp = session.get('mock://test.com/5')
    >>> resp.status_code, resp.headers, resp.text
    (200, {'Test1': 'value1', 'Test2': 'value2'}, 'response')
